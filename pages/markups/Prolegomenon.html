    </h1>
    <p>
      Any writing system, far from the media carry it, needs a system for
      formatting; Even in antiquity and middle ages copiers and writers used
      methods for formatting the written text; Therefore, in codices we can
      see using red ink, underlining, using bigger or smaller pens and a few
      symbols. In modern time, after IT explosion we tried a couple of systems
      of markup languages to formatting texts. For this goal modern human
      invent a lot of markups with their rules, tools and file extensions.
      Among this artifacts two umbrella concepts are important:
      <strong>Markup languages</strong>, and <strong>word processors</strong>.
      No need to mention that these concepts could be seen as two sides of a
      coin, since word processors rely on markup systems. Thus, word
      processors are dispensable, in the way that, theoretically speaking,
      only after choosing a markup language one could choose a word processor;
      although, in reality sometimes the word processor impose its own markup.
      I can guess some reader might find discussing
      <em>markup languages</em> in details unnecessary and <em>pedantic</em>;
      because it may seems a shallow and skin-deep, but it is not. Sometimes
      the word processor or the markup language interfere with writer's
      <strong>thinking</strong>, a fragile human phenomenon, and cause
      interruptions in the process. Thinking, at its core, is fragile, liquid
      and fugitive; one small event demolish our thoughts, in such a way that
      the thinker agent would not be able to retrieve it. Does not it
      important? Additionally, there is no account for have a lot of
      formatting options whose role are dispensable usually. However, I should
      be more precise in these points, hence let me define a handful terms. In
      the meantime, giving easy-to-remember, verbose definition would not be a
      bad idea as sometimes nonsense explanations are flying over the web. A
      few month ago I saw a post for
      <em>"why HTML is not a programming language?"</em> with six reasons to
      prove it! when <code>HTML</code> had been a
      <em>programming language</em>? it has never been. Because always it was
      a markup language which the acronym comes from
      <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong> in which "markup" stated,
      while people may forget.
    </p>
    <h2>Markup Languages, Lightweight Markups and WYSIWYG</h2>
    <p>
      Defining <strong>Markup</strong>,
      <strong>Lightweight Markup</strong> and <strong>WYSIWYG</strong> (What
      You See Is What You Get) make the question in hand clear enough to
      proceed. as the audience of this words is public opinion, I will avoid
      academic jargon, committing to more understandable style. Thus my
      favorite definition of these terms are these:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Markup Language</strong>: a markup language is a system of
        rules (perhaps codes and tags) that shape the layout of the document,
        format the texts and words, and make it more readable by human agents.
        These goals fulfills mostly by wrapping text inside the width of the
        screen, differentiate parts of texts by different font typeface,
        outstanding titles and their levels by bigger letter and boldness, put
        emphasize on words and phrases by <strong>boldness</strong>,
        <em>italicizing</em>, underlining and different colors. Markup
        languages are used mostly in opposition to raw text document formats,
        or structured-data format languages, etc. A raw text, like a piece of
        document in <code>.txt</code> file is not a markup, as all parts are
        in one size, no boldness, no italicization and no wrapping; therefore,
        if you open the file in a text editor a line with 300 words remain in
        one single line, so that you have to use horizontal scroll bar to see
        the left. Or in structured-data format documents reading the data,
        even when they are just regular expressions, is not easy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lightweight Markup Languages</strong>: a lightweight markup
        language is a markup language with simplest, unobtrusive, the least
        rules and tags as much as possible, i.e. the simplest and smallest
        number of rules and tags that are enough for a regular text to be
        readable with ease by humans. As human expressions carry meaning in
        different ways, a markup language have to give possibilities to all
        kinds; note it worthy that <strong>emphasis</strong> is
        <em>meaningful</em> in statements and plays a role. Hence, markups
        have to include at least one option for emphasizing. In addition, in
        case of any <em>distraction</em>, a markup language must offer rules
        and possibilities to help the readers focus on the text and help them
        to find the line or word they are looking for. A markup language that
        provides these possibilities, with a few others, is lightweight markup
        language. Lightweight markups used in contrast to common markups, i.e.
        there is not counter-parts like "heavyweight". Common markups which
        are not lightweight are for more technical purposes like scientific
        papers which need charts, different direction writings, complicated
        table, etc; When a certain document needs more complicated formats,
        objects and styles a lightweight markup would not be helpful. Thus we
        always need markup languages like <code>.tex</code> (LaTex),
        <code>.odt</code> (Open Document), <code>.xml</code> (eXtensible
        Markup Language), <code>.docx</code> (MS Word),
        <code>.pages</code> (Mac Pages), etc. to fulfill these tasks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>WYSIWYG</strong>: this term, which is acronym for "<em><strong>W</strong>hat <strong>Y</strong>ou
          <strong>G</strong>et
          <strong>I</strong>S <strong>W</strong>hat <strong>Y</strong>ou
          <strong>S</strong>ee</em>" is not a markup per se, but it describes a software that gets users
        commands in graphical user input instead of gets user orders in terms
        of written tags (or codes). Putting WYSIWYG next to markup definitions
        makes the list heterogeneous, and I am aware of that. The reason is a
        number of markup languages like Microsoft <code>DOCX</code> (or
        previous <code>DOC</code> version), or Mac <code>PAGES</code> are
        known with their word processor which produces them in WYSIWYG way; as
        far as they are closed and propriety formats we could take the
        processor in place of the format. This issue discussed below more.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Here I did not deal with markup languages such as <code>epub</code>,
      <code>pdf</code>, <code>djvu</code>, etc. Because the issue for this
      discussion is the formats that used by writers at first place, while
      EPUB, PDF, DJVU are not used in the first place, but rather, after the
      document prepared then it convert to these systems for distribution
      among readers.
    </p>
    <h2>Lightweight Markups Versus WYSIWYGs</h2>
    <p>
      As it mentioned above, Markup languages and WYSIWYG word processors are
      not in the same kind, so that listing them together is not correct
      technically; one reason stated above: they are known their markup
      language which are not open source. Therefore, only the same processor
      could create it. But there is another important reason to comparing
      lightweight markups with WYSIWYGs:
      <strong>Lightweight markup languages are ceded and overcome by WYSIWYGs; That
        is, people prefer markup languages such as <code>docx</code> or
        <code>odt</code> due to they could be created by a WYSIWYG word
        processor.</strong>
      as far as we want to deal with lightweight markups, not doing a kind of
      Aristotelian classification, such an attitude serve the purpose well.
    </p>
    <h2>The Advent of WYSIWYGs</h2>
    <p>
      As <strong>WYSIWYG</strong> (What You <strong>See</strong> Is What You
      Get) word processors conquered the 21st century, one might wonder why
      should we use a lightweight markup language, or any other markup
      language that whose formatting needs to be write down, instead of using
      mouse and toolbars; it is a smart question which may guide us to
      somewhere good. For common people, who are not familiar with many
      different alternatives to those WYSIWYGs, this question answered simply
      and naively by expressing phrases like:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        There is no good in using something like boring lightweight markups
        when we have MS Word, Google Docs and even in open source community
        LibreOffice, Abiword and Calligra.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I emphasized the word "see" in the phrase, because that word might be
      the key to understand the situation. Most of the time, people who are
      not in favor of lightweight markups, find lightweight markups difficult
      to deal with or learn or just seem weird to them. <code>Markdown</code>,
      <code>commonmark</code>, other Markdowns(<code>Github flavored</code>,
      <code>Extra</code>, <code>R</code>, etc), <code>Textile</code>,
      <code>Restructuredtext</code>, <code>Gemtext</code>, <code>RDoc</code>,
      <code>Asciidoc</code>, a couple of other formats, and most recently
      <code>Jdot</code> are in a line when it comes to this specific question.
      When we, people who prefer lightweight markups over, let say, MS Word
      format, <code>.docx</code>, it might be understood as a sub-culture for
      a community, a kind of behavior which we like to do just to be
      different, distinguishing ourselves from our fellow humans; do we?
      absolutely not. Although, justifying this point needs a lot of work to
      be done before. On the other hand, suppose we are right about the
      lightweight markups, why, then, we have not succeeded in that goal and
      still lightweight markups is not popular? that would be another question
      which must be meet after the first one.
    </p>
    <h2>The Road-map</h2>
    <p>
      I would divide the discussion into two main section, inn which
      <strong><em>"Love and Squalor"</em></strong> borrowed from the name of a
      short story of <em>J. D. Salinjer</em>,
      <em>"with Love and Squalor"</em>:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>the merit and love</strong> of lightweight markup languages;
      </li>
      <li>
        the <strong>demerit and squalor</strong> of lightweight markups.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      in the first section we look into markups, in particular, lightweight
      ones; in doing that we take the merit of them into account. The reason
      of repeating <strong><em>"lightweight"</em></strong> again and again is
      that comparing other markups such as <code>HTML</code>,
      <code>LaTex</code>, <code>odt</code> (<strong>OpenDocument</strong>),
      with other formats needs different attitude which does not apply to
      lightweights necessarily. in a markup language like <code>HTML</code> or
      <code>LaTex</code> there are different issues. thus, it is a wise act to
      stick to lightweights. in this section we scrutinize the lightweight
      markups and comparing them with
      <em>WYSIWYG_s, such as <code>.docx</code> (_MS Word</em> format). note
      it worthy that in this comparison there is a point: lightweight markups
      like Markdown, essentially are document formats, and <code>.docx</code>,
      as well; if we compare MS Word with Markdown it is not a good comparison
      as the former is an application and the latter is a document format. but
      this is just a kind of figure of speech, since a well-shaped
      <code>.docx</code> could be generated only by MS Word. Although other
      applications, like <strong>LibreOffice</strong>, could produce
      <code>.docx</code> files but their production behave in a strange way.
      Regarding second section, we will take a look into the dark part of
      lightweight markups, i.e. what deprive them from being popular. perhaps
      this second part is more important; as many people do not care about
      reason but they seek performance, simplicity, and user-friendliness. you
      can lecture a group about avoiding one certain thing and get their
      approval, but they do not abandon it unless there would be another
      <em>alternative</em>
      option.
