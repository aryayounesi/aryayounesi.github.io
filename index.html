        A few words on anything which code be written in codes, i.e., any kind of
        <em>meaning</em> that could be shaped in terms of well-designed, syntactically true depends
        on pre-existed rules, in a way it could carry a meaningful statement either for human or
        machine. one may asked:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>why these explanations is important? why do not just say a few words of developing?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        the answer would be: <strong><em>no</em></strong
        >. because the target is not just to build applications with good performance and clean
        codes, but more than that.
      </p>
      <h2>What is the <strong>scopus</strong>?</h2>
      <p>
        the subject matter here, the scopus, the main question that guide whole discussion is a
        question that possibly divided into more specific questions, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>how the programming languages are shaped?</li>
        <li>
          could we see all programming languages <em>well-structured</em>, <em>unique readable</em>?
        </li>
        <li>what about the role of compilers/interpreters?</li>
        <li>how much a certain language could avoid ambiguity?</li>
        <li>
          if it is possible to have ambiguity, then how the compilers/interpreters deal with these
          vagueness?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        issues like these catch my attention; because they represent another part of my interests:
        <em>philosophy of language</em>. like what we seek in
        <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2022/entries/logic-classical/"
          >Classical Logic</a
        >
        and
        <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ai/#nl"
          >Logical/artificial languages vs. natural languages</a
        >. the way this days people deal with these topics could be describe as
        <em>inappropriate</em>, as a matter of opinion; since, if one search for any kind
        programming language the likelihood that she/he could find reviews of these matters is very
        low to zero.
      </p>
      <h2>The Name</h2>
      <p>
        I borrowed the name from Latin which could be a little perplexing, but let us understand in
        a way that we understand the
        <strong>Corpus Aristotelicum</strong> or <strong>Corpus Galenicum</strong> or
        <strong>Corpus Hippocraticum</strong>, all in meaning of
        <strong><em>the whole ordered writings</em></strong
        >. in Latin, <em>corpus</em> means <em>body</em>,
        <em>a set which make the body of something</em>; thus, mentioned terms means the
        <em>body</em> of those philosophers' works. furthermore, <em>code</em>, or <em>codex</em>,
        basically means <em>tree trunk</em> or a certain kind of it, which they wax leafs made out
        of them to be used for writing; <em>Codices</em> is the plural form of it. enough for
        etymology. we obtained codices from this meaning, any set of letters with a correct syntax
        and semantic on something, no matter it is a even stone, leaf, papyrus, parchment, modern
        paper, on a storage or screen.
